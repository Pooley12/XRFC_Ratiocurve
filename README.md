Generating Ratiocurves for analysing X-ray Framing Cameras (XRFC) / Gated X-ray Detectors (GXD)

The spectral emission, detector response and ratiocurve is calculated with Ratiocurve_calculation.py
This requires access to the Prism code Spect3D (https://www.prism-cs.com/Software/Spect3D/overview.html)
