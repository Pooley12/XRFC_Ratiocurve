Generating Ratiocurves for analysing X-ray Framing Cameras (XRFC) / Gated X-ray Detectors (GXD)

The spectral emission, detector response and ratiocurve is calculated with Ratiocurve_calculation.py.

Filter responses are generated using Heneke tables (https://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/).

Detector sensitivity is an extension of G. A. Rochau et al. "Energy dependent sensitivity of microchannel plate detectors." Rev. Sci. Instrum. 77, 10E323 (2006).
   

Spectral emission is calculated using the Prism code Spect3D (https://www.prism-cs.com/Software/Spect3D/overview.html).
